            <p>I always identify with the fact that I am a Christian entrepreneur and as a result, it
positions me somewhat differently, I think, from other entrepreneurs because I believe that the consummate entrepreneur is God himself. Now let me tell you how I read the Bible, I read the Bible as an entrepreneur and the whole aspect of entrepreneurship is summed up in Genesis chapter 1.  If you think you're an entrepreneur even if you're a non-Christian, I want you to listen to this for a minute. 
</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-8" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
            <p>
              The Bible begins with the fact or the acknowledgment in Genesis chapter 1, and I'm not going to preach any further beyond that I'm a lay preacher. Still, Genesis chapter 1 fascinates me to no end because, in the first verse, it says “In the beginning, God created”, so God creates something out of nothing. It tells me the earth in verse 2 was without form and an empty waste and darkness prevailed upon it in the face of great deed so in other words there was nothing. 
This sounds a bit like Africa, sounds like the rural areas, at night, darkness
and nothing right, 
and then God appears and when God appears so does light and so enlightenment comes from God, that's how I interpret it,
</p>
           
            <p>
              God is the consummate entrepreneur because he starts with nothing and many of you have nothing but you want to be entrepreneurs, but, if you go to any entrepreneur in most African countries, they say give me capita, no no no it doesn't start with the capital, I'm an investment banker and I'll tell you money will always follow a compelling Vision. Whether it's borrowed money or family money or wherever you're going to source money for your enterprise, money will always follow a compelling dream, money will follow hard work and Entrepreneurship starts right there so God in my caricature of entrepreneurship begins with nothing but clearly, he begins with an idea. So in other words God had to think through creativity. 
Every little thing and every big thing that he created, began with the thoughts, see the power of an idea. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you go on when he creates a human being in verse 26, that is his ultimate, his pan ultimate creation when he creates a man and a woman, so always remember and say to yourself, I am wonderfully made because it's true, you were wonderfully made, listen to what it takes to create a man it says God said “let us” so for the first time in the Bible he summons his total being Father, Son and Holy Spirit and he says now “...let us produce a human being”. So you are not an animal, it means you are God-like, and being God-like means we can create something out of nothing because God-like means we are like God, we start when there is confusion, we begin when there is Darkness we begin when there is nothing, isn't that amazing, that's how I read my Bible. He summons his whole being and then he creates a man and a woman and then as though for emphasis three times in verse 27 he says so God created man in his own image number one, number two in the image and likeness of God he created him number three, triple emphasis! Male and female he created them, oh my God I could stop right there, I get goosebumps when I hear that so it says it took God's totality to make man to be like him and then he emphasized it three times over that we are like God. I could stop right there, it means I can start anything that I want from nothing and you can do the same.
            </p>

            <p>
              As Africans, you should give a big amen because you didn't know that, because you wait for the Foreigners, you wait for the capital, you wait for the mentor you wait for anything, you make every excuse not to start and I can tell you when I read that passage of scripture, I then said to myself I have what it takes and I am going to start my dream project which was a tech-startup from nothing, no capital, no mentor to walk me through and I said I'm going to start anyway because I am full. I am full, I have what it takes to start anything because God began to do anything and everything out of nothing but it begins with an idea and we follow a pattern.
            </p>

            <p>
              It also then goes to a declaration that it is done because God declares “...Let There Be” and then he works and it is so, we see a pattern for entrepreneurship in Genesis Chapter 1, and then he gives us the steps and for you entrepreneurs you would say he gives us the Prototype of how you start a business verse 28, it says “... and God blessed them”, step number one. You are blessed so turn to yourself and say i am blessed. So imagine this is the first conversation that God has with this thing called man and this thing called woman, the first one is a declaration that you are blessed. So those thoughts of saying i am poor, this mindset that I have nothing noo, you can't have nothing when you are blessed, so your starting point is knowing who you are and whose you are and who manufactured you, it is God himself and he gave you the ability to be the most creative animal there is on the face of the earth in other words you've got what it takes.
            </p>

            <p>
               Then he said to them in terms of instruction, “...be fruitful”, and some of you think it's about making babies, oh my goodness I told you I don't read the Bible like that, I read the Bible by saying okay when he says be fruitful he means be productive, he means ideate, he means create, that's the second instruction next he says multiply. So the power of this one idea, one thought, you multiply it, in other words, you produce after that very one. He didn't say add to that idea he didn't say divide that idea he didn't say subtract from that idea, but he went on to say multiply. So, even one idea, you are supposed to replicate it, not by zero or by one but several times over, it's got to be important, 
            </p>

            <p>
              I did Bible School and in Bible school we talk of the law of first mention, so in this particular instance, we are saying the law of first discussion between Mankind and God, and he's already giving the instructions so it's got to be important right, so when he's saying multiply he then says “...and fill the earth”, in other words go local, go Regional and go Global with that one idea, multiply and what?
and fill the Earth.    
            </p>

            <p>
              In other words, your business idea in this realm of creativity does not stop
local, it's got foreign versions because when God created mankind he created a
man, one man, on one continent in one space then varieties of that idea were
multiplied, world over and here we are today 8.2 billion of us of different shapes and sizes is’nt God the consummate entrepreneur? out of nothing, out of one, many have arisen then he goes on to say “...have dominion” in my mind as an entrepreneur when I read that it means have governance, have control, things can't just go helter-skelter, noo, you've got to have command of those things.
            </p>

            <p>and there ends my sermon.</p>
